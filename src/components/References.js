She has a strong sense of which scenes advance the story, a keen eye for key details, and an ability to uncover elements everyone else overlooks. If your show idea needs fleshing out, or you’re in search of compelling ideas, Megan is a truly valuable resource.”

                        Megan produces our twice-monthly NüVoices podcast, which promotes the expertise of women and gender minorities on China. Her meticulous editing and sound design has elevated our podcast quality significantly, helping attract new listeners. On top of this, Megan has gone above and beyond to co-host episodes as well as commission and oversee the creation of our podcast’s custom intro and outro music. Megan is as talented as she is wonderful to work with on a day-to-day basis, with excellent communication and coordination skills. She has brought a lot of energy and kindness to the NüVoices global community!
